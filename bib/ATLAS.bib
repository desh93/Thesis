Understanding this link sheds light on the properties of these partons. A review of various common jet algorithms is presented, namely the Kt , Anti-Kt , Cambridge/Aachen, Iterative cones and the SIScone, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. If one is interested in studying jets, the Anti-Kt algorithm is the best choice, however if ones interest is in the jet substructures then the Cambridge/Aachen algorithm would be the best option.}
