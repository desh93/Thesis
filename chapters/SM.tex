\chapter{The Standard Model of particle physics}\label{chap:SM}
The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a quantum field theory (QFT) with multiple interacting fields and symmetries. Developed during the second half of the $20^{\mathrm{th}}$ century, there has been an excellent agreement between the predictions of the SM and experimental data from particle physics experiments. Examples include, the predicted magnetic dipole moment of an electron agrees with the measured value to a very high precision. Further verifications of the SM include the discovery of the Top quark by CDF and D$\emptyset$ experiments at the Tevatron \protonproton collider~\cite{Abe1995,Abachi1995}. The tau neutrino~\cite{Kodama_2001} in 2009. The most recent validation of the SM was via the observation of the Higgs Boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC in 2012~\cite{Chatrchyan2012,Aad_2012}. This chapter will give a brief introduction into the Standard Model of particle physics, and its interactions. The strong, electroweak and Higgs interactions are also discussed. 

\section{Introduction}
The SM is a gauge theory that describes the elementary particle and their fundamental interactions (excluding gravity). Interactions of the SM are considered in terms of fields, $\psi$, of half-integer spin fermions and integer spin gauge bosons. The fermions consist of 12 particles in total classified into quarks and leptons. The gauge bosons mediate the fundamental forces between the fermions. The SM describes three fundamental forces: the electromagnetic, the weak, and the strong interaction.  

Symmetries are central to our current understanding of particle physics. In particle physics, a symmetry of the universe is expressed by requiring that all physical predictions are unchanged or invariant under transformations. The importance of the concept of symmetries originates from Noether's theorem~\cite{Noether1918}, stipulating that for every continuous symmetry there is a corresponding conservation law. The full gauge symmetry group of the SM is given by $\mathrm{SU(3)}_\mathrm{C} \otimes \mathrm{SU(2)}_\mathrm{L} \otimes \mathrm{U(1)}_\mathrm{Y}$. The indices C, L, Y represent the \emph{colour} (strong interaction), \emph{weak isospin} and \emph{weak hypercharge} (both electroweak interactions), respectively. The electroweak theory unifies the electromagnetic and weak interaction. It based on the conservation of electric charge, Q, which is convolved in the weak isospin and hypercharge. The description of the strong interaction is based on the theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)~\cite{Zweig:1964jf}. The conserved quantity in QCD is the colour charge (C), where it represented by three colours: red, green, and blue. 

\section{The standard model Lagrangian}
The SM can be expressed as a \emph{Lagrangian density} given by:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lagrangianSM}
    \begin{aligned}
        & \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{SM} = \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Fermions} + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Gauge~Bosons} + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Higgs} + \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Yukawa}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The following sections will review each of the components of the SM Lagrangian. These sections are based on ~\cite{Thomson:2013zua,Peskin:1995ev}

\subsection{Fermion fields}\label{sec:fermionFields}
The first component of the Lagrangian in \cref{eq:lagrangianSM} describes the propagation and interactions of fermions. There are three generations of particles observed in the fermion sector. Each generation has the same fundamental properties except for the different masses. The fermions are be categorised into three distinct types: Weyl, Dirac and Majorana. Weyl fermions are massless, Dirac fermions are massive, and Majorana fermions are particles that are the same as its antiparticle. All SM fermions are Dirac fermions after symmetry breaking, with the exception of neutrinos as their nature is not yet determined to be Dirac or Majorana. 

The quark fields are charged under the SU(3) colour group. They are represented as as colour triplets transforming with the corresponding representation of SU(3). Whereas, the lepton fields are colour singlets, which results in them not being charged under the strong interaction. Therefore, the fermions are categorised into families of particles that interact via the strong interaction and ones that do not, these are termed quarks and leptons, respectively. Each lepton generation contains an electrically charged particle and one which is neutrally charged. The quark generations are split into up-type and down-type quarks which have an electric charge of $+\frac{2}{3}$ and $-\frac{1}{3}$, respectively. 

Fermion fields are described by the following Dirac Lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lagrangianFermion}
    \begin{aligned}
        & \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Fermion} = \bar{\psi}\left(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m\right)\psi,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma_mu$ are the Dirac matrices~\cite{doi:10.1098/rspa.1928.0023}. Imposing gauge invariance under SU(2)$_\mathrm{L}$ and U(1)$_\mathrm{Y}$ rotations, the Dirac Lagrangian can be written in terms of the covariant derivative, $D_\mu$, where the partial derivatives are replaced by it. The covariant derivative describes the interaction of the fermion field with the gauge field. 

The distinction between \emph{left-handed} and \emph{right-handed} fermions are made in the SM. This is a result of the field transformations under the SU(2)$_\mathrm{L}$ symmetry group. The left-handed fermions are grouped into weak isospin doublets with $T = \frac{1}{2}$ and the right-handed fermions are grouped into weak isospin singlets with $T = 0$, where $T$ is the weak isospin. 

In the Lagrangian for the electroweak unification, the weak hypercharge, $Y$, is defined in terms of the electric charge $Q$ and the third component of the weak isospin $T^3$ by the equation:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:hypercharge}
    \begin{aligned}
        & Y = 2Q - 2T^3.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
This results in $Y = -1, -\frac{1}{3}$ for the weak isopsin doublets and $Y = -2,\frac{4}{3},-\frac{2}{3}$ for the weak isospin singlets. \cref{tab:fermions} shows the quantum numbers of the generations of both left and right handed fermions under the electroweak symmetry group. A consequence of the left handed doublets and the right handed singlets is that the Dirac mass terms for the fermion fields are not gauge invariant under the SU(2)$_\mathrm{L} \otimes \mathrm{U}(1)_\mathrm{Y}$ transformations. There for an alternative mechanism is needed to impose gauge invariance. The alternative mechanism will be introduce in \cref{sec:symmbreak}. The right handed neutrinos are often omitted from the construction of the SM, as they have not yet been observed experimentally, but appear in many models for generating the experimentally oberved neutrino mass~\cite{Ahmad2002}.

\end{table}

\subsection{Gauge fields}\label{sec:gaugeFields}
The second component of the SM Lagrangian, $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Gauge bosons}}$, describes the propagation of gauge bosons. The gauge field lagrangian is given by: 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lagrangianGauge}
    \begin{aligned}
        & \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Gauge Bosons} = -\frac{1}{4}G^a_{\mu\nu}G_a^{\mu\nu} -\frac{1}{4}W^a_{\mu\nu}W_a^{\mu\nu} -\frac{1}{4}B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu},
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the fields correspond to transformations of their respective symmetry groups. $B_\mu$  are the gauge fields corresponding to the to the U(1)$_\mathrm{Y}$ transformation. $W_\mu^a$ with $a = 1,2,3$ corresponds to the SU(2)$_\mathrm{L}$ transformation. Finally $G_\mu^a$ with $a = 1,..,8$ corresponds to the transformations under SU(3)$_\mathrm{C}$. 

The differences between these fields are a result of the different nature of the corresponding symmetry groups. Self interactions between the $W_\mu$ and $G_\mu$ gauge fields are possible due to the non-abelian nature of the SU(2)$_\mathrm{L}$ and SU(3)$_\mathrm{C}$ groups. Whereas, due to the the abelian nature U(1)$_\mathrm{Y}$ group, self interactions between the fields are not possible. 

As mentioned in \cref{sec:fermionFields}, a covariant derivative, $D_\mu$, is defined to describe the coupling between the fermion fields and gauge fields. The full covariant derivative for a fermion interacting with all three fields (e.g. quarks) is defined as: 

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:covaariantDerv}
    \begin{aligned}
        & D_\mu \psi = \left(\partial_\mu - ig_s\frac{\lambda_a}{2}G^a_\mu - igT_aW^a_\mu - ig^\prime YB_\mu\right)\psi,
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $g^\prime$, $g$ and $g_s$ are the coupling constants of the U(1)$_\mathrm{Y}$, SU(2)$_\mathrm{L}$ and SU(3)$_\mathrm{C}$ interactions, respectively. $\lambda_a$, $T_a$ and $Y$ are the generators of the respective fields. The SU(3)$_\mathrm{C}$ gauge field is omitted for fermions that do not interact via the strong force. Using this definition for the covariant derivative, the partial derivatives in the Dirac lagrangian can be replaced and the interactions for the electroweak and QCD components can be determined. 

\subsubsection{The electroweak interaction}\label{sec:electroweak}
Historically the electromagnetic and weak interactions were treated separately. The electromagnetic for is mediated by massless photons that propagate over an infinite range. The photons can interact with any particles which carry an electrical charge. The theory that describes the electromagnetic interaction is Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The weak nuclear interaction acts on short length and time scales due the large mass of its force carriers. The weak bosons interact with left-handed fermions carrying a weak isospin quantum number. The weak force has two types of interactions: a charged current and a neutral current interaction.  

A unification of the two theories, the electroweak theory was developed by Glashow, Salam and Weinberg~\cite{Glashow1959,Salam1959,Weinberg1967}. As a result the electroweak theory is sometimes also referred to as the \emph{GSW} theory. The electroweak interactions are described by the SU(2)$_\mathrm{L}\otimes\mathrm{U(1)}_\mathrm{Y}$ symmetry group. The requirement for gauge invariance under these two symmetry groups leads to the following Lagrangian:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lagrangianEW}
    \begin{aligned}
        & \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{EW} = \bar{\psi}\left(\slashed{D}\right)\psi - \frac{1}{4}W^a_{\mu\nu}W_a^{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{4}B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu},
     \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\slashed{D} = \gamma^\mu D_\mu$, and is the covariant derivative with the SU(3)$_\mathrm{C}$ gauge fields omitted. The gauge fields in the above Lagrangian are not what is observed in nature, but a combination of the of these fields form the observed fields in nature. The charged $W^\pm_\mu$ fields can be obtained via a linear combination of $W^1_\mu$ and $W^2_\mu$. The $Z$ boson field, $Z_\mu$, and the photon field, $A_\mu$ is obtained via rotations of the fields $W_\mu^3$ and $B_\mu$ around the weak mixing angle $\theta_w$ to give:
\begin{equation}\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{\newarraystrech}
    \label{eq:wbosonFields}
    \begin{aligned}
        & W^\pm_\mu = \frac{1}{2} \left(W^1_\mu + W^2_\mu \right), \\
     \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{\newarraystrech}
    \label{eq:zbosonFields}
    \begin{aligned}
        & \begin{pmatrix}
            A_\mu \\
            Z_\mu
        \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}
            \cos \theta_W & \sin \theta_W \\
            -\sin \theta_W & \cos \theta_W
        \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}
            B_\mu \\
            W_\mu^3
        \end{pmatrix}.
     \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The \emph{W}-bosons carry the weak charge, and the \emph{Z}-bosons and photons carry the electric charge. Experimental results have confirmed the existence of $W^\pm$ and $Z$ bosons, with masses of $m_W = 80.36 \pm 0.02$ and $m_Z = 91.187 \pm 0.002$ \SI{}{\giga\electronvolt}, respectively~\cite{PDG}. However, the inclusion of the mass term violates in the SM Lagrangian violates the SU(2)$_\mathrm{L} \otimes \mathrm{U(1)}_\mathrm{Y}$ symmetry. This along with the masses of the fermions requires the introduction of the theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking, commonly known as the Higgs mechanism, which is discussed further in \cref{sec:symmbreak}.

\subsubsection{Quantum Chromodynamics}
The SU(3)$_\mathrm{C}$ symmetry group corresponds to the strong nuclear force and it's interactions are described by Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Much of the structure and notation of the result gauge interactions have already been discussed. However, there are important differences that are a result of the SU(3)$_\mathrm{C}$ group. The couplings between the quarks and gluons are defined from the SU(3)$_\mathrm{C}$. For quarks, the Lagrangian can be written as: 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lagrangianQuark}
    \begin{aligned}
        & \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Quark}^\mathrm{Interaction} = \frac{g_s}{2}\bar{\psi}_q \left(\gamma_\mu \lambda_a G_\mu^a \right)\psi_q ,
     \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $g_s$ is the coupling constant of the strong interaction. The coupling constant, $g_s$, is written as $\alpha_s = \frac{g_s^2}{4\pi}$ for convenience of calculation, and is a fundamental parameter of QCD, along with the quark masses. Using the QCD parameters a scattering amplitude between the initial and final state particles can be evaluated in powers of $\alpha_s$. However, in QFT there will be ultraviolet (UV) divergences that are a result of Feynman diagrams~\cite{Thomson:2013zua} containing loops. The divergences need to be fixed using a renormalisation procedure, which involves including a scale in the theory, $\mu_R$, above which the UV divergences are removed. However, the strength of the coupling will depend on the scale it is evaluated at. The beta function is introduced to define the scale ($Q^2$) dependence of the coupling via the renormalisation group equation (RGE):
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:rge}
    \begin{aligned}
        & Q^2 \frac{\partial\alpha_s}{\partial\mu_R^2} = \beta(\alpha_s) = -\beta_0\alpha_s^2(1+\beta_1\alpha_s + \beta_2\alpha_s^2+ ..),
     \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\beta_0 = (33-2n_f)/(12\pi)$, is known as the 1-loop $\beta$ function coefficient. $n_f$ denotes the number of quark flavours. \cref{fig:alphasrun} depicts the dependence of $alpha_s$ on energy scale. This defines the characteristic properties of the QCD interactions: \emph{asymptotic freedom} and \emph{quark confinement}. 
\begin{figure}[!htpb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{/Users/Deshan/Documents/PhD/thesis/Thesis/figures/theory/sm/asq-2015.pdf}
    \caption{Summary of experimental measurements of $\alpha_s$ as a function of energy scale Q~\cite{PDG}}
    \label{fig:alphasrun}
\end{figure}
As $Q^2$ increases the coupling of the strong interaction tends to zero. This process is known as asymptotic freedom, and it is observed experimentally as shown in \cref{fig:alphasrun}. Calculations involving perturbation theory for the coupling constant becomes increasingly valid for larger $Q^2$. However, as $Q^2$ gets smaller, the coupling between the quarks becomes strong and prevents them from existing as isolated particles. This phenomena is known as quark confinement. The increase in potential energy as $Q^2$ increases is large enough to create quark and anti-quark paris in a process known as \emph{hadronisation}. 

\subsection{Electroweak symmetry breaking}\label{sec:symmbreak}
As described in the previous sections, explicit mass terms can not be used for fermions and massive gauge bosons. Therefore, the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism~\cite{Higgs1964,Englert1964}, commonly referred to as the Higgs mechanism, is used to introduce gauge invariant mass terms for the particles. A new field is introduced which has gauge invariant transformations under SU(2)$_\mathrm{L}\otimes\mathrm{U(1)}_\mathrm{Y}$. It is a complex scalar field in the SM Lagrangian that is an isospin doublet with hypercharge $Y = \frac{1}{2}$, defined as
\begin{equation}\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{\newarraystrech}
    \label{eq:scalarfield}
    \begin{aligned}
        & \Phi = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            \phi^+ \\
            \phi^- 
        \end{pmatrix} =
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            \phi_1 + i\phi_2 \\
            \phi_3 + i\phi_4
        \end{pmatrix}.
     \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The gauge invariant Lagrangian is then defined as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:lagrangianhiggs}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Higgs} &= (D^\mu\Phi)^\dagger(D^\mu\Phi) - V(\Phi), \\
        V(\Psi) &= - \mu^2\Phi^\dagger\Phi + \lambda(\Phi^\dagger\Phi)^2,
     \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
using the covariant derivative defined in \cref{sec:electroweak}. $\mu$ and $\lambda$ are free parameters. For $\mu^2 > 0$ the potential has a minimum at $\phi = 0$, where the minimum corresponds vacuum. This corresponds to a Lagrangian with scalar particles of mass $\mu$. However, when $\mu^2 < 0$, the potential has degenerate minimum at $v = \mu/\sqrt{\lambda}$, where $v$ is the \emph{vacuum expectation value}, and results in spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the potential, the self-coupling parameter $\lambda$ is chosen to be positive to ensure that the potential is bound from below.  $\phi_1 = \phi_2 = \phi_4 = 0$ and $\phi_3 = v + h(x)$ is chosen as convention. The scalar field, $h(x)$, is identified as the Higgs field. The minimum of the potential after the spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs for the neutral component of the scalar field doublet to preserve U(1) symmetry. The non-zero vacuum expectation value results in the breaking of the SU(2)$_\mathrm{L}\otimes\mathrm{U(1)}_\mathrm{Y}$ symmetry to $\mathrm{U(1)}_\mathrm{EM}$ symmetry. After symmetry breaking, $\Phi$ takes the form 
\begin{equation}\renewcommand*{\arraystretch}{\newarraystrech}
    \label{eq:higgsfield}
    \begin{aligned}
        & \Phi = 
        \begin{pmatrix}
            0\\
            v + h(x)
        \end{pmatrix}.
     \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Using the Lagrangian in \cref{eq:lagrangianhiggs}, and expanding the kinetic terms, results in a series of terms describing the interactions of the gauge bosons with the vacuum and the Higgs field. This leads to the vector boson masses, 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:bosonmasses}
    \begin{aligned}
        m_W &= \frac{gv}{2},\\
        m_Z &= \frac{1}{2}(g^2 + g^{\prime 2})^{\frac{1}{2}}v,
     \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and the photon remains massless. The masses acquired by the $W^\pm$ and $Z$ gauge bosons is expected by Goldstone's theorem~\cite{PhysRev.127.965}, which states that the vanishing degrees of freedom under SU(2)$_\mathrm{L}$ correspond to Goldstone bosons and are "eaten" to give mass to the associated gauge fields. 

Using the scalar doublet defined in \cref{eq:higgsfield}, fermion masses can also be incorporated. Using the first generation of quarks as an example and defining the SU(2)$_\mathrm{L}$ doublet for left handed quarks, a Yukawa Lagrangian can be written as, 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:YukawaLagrangian}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Yukawa} &= -\lambda_d Q_L \Phi d_R - \lambda_u Q_L \tilde{\Phi}u_R + h.c,
     \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_{d}$ and $\lambda_u$ are the Yukawa couplings of the down and up type quarks, respectively. h.c refers to the addition of the Hermitian conjugate of the Higgs doublet and $\tilde{\Phi} = -i\sigma_w\Phi$. By replacing the scalar field with an expression around the vacuum expectation value after symmetry breaking gives fermion mass terms of the form
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fermionmass}
    \begin{aligned}
        m_d = \frac{\lambda_d v}{\sqrt{2}},~~m_u = \frac{\lambda_u v}{\sqrt{2}}.
     \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Including all generations of fermions results in non zero Yukawa couplings that mix flavour generations. The resulting matrix can be diagonalised by performing the unitary transformations between the weak- and mass-bases of the fermion fields. This rotation gives rise to \emph{charge-parity} (CP) violation in the charged current interactions, parametrised by the CKM matrix~\cite{10.1143/PTP.49.652} matrix in the quark sector and the PMNS matrix~\cite{Maki1962} in the leptonic sector. However, the mass terms for the neutrinos are often omitted from the SM due to the lack of experimental evidence. Inclusion of the mixing between leptons would require an extraordinary large mass difference between the charged and neutral leptons within each lepton generation. 

Finally, after electroweak symmetry breaking, and the Higgs field acquiring the vacuum expectation value, the Higgs mas is given as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:higgsmass}
    \begin{aligned}
        m_h = \sqrt{2\lambda}v.
     \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
In 2012, the SM Higgs boson was discovered with $m_h \sim \SI{125.09}{\giga\electronvolt}$~\cite{Aad_2012,Chatrchyan2012} by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at CERN.
