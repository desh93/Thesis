\begin{declaration}
    I declare that the work presented in this thesis is my own.
    Where the work of others has been consulted, this has been indicated in the text.

    \cref{chap:SM,chap:bsm,chap:expSetup,chap:SimReco} provide descriptions of the theoretical and experimental topics that are relevant for this thesis. The chapters were written based on previous literature, which include: papers, technical reports and academic text. I was one of two analysis contacts for the result presented in this thesis, which included planning the analysis and leading team members towards publication of the result. \cref{chap:eventsel,chap:datamc} include work carried out in collaboration with the team, where work by members of the group have been explicitly referenced. My original work in close collaboration with the other analysis contact is presented in \cref{chap:bkgmodel,chap:uncertBkgmodel,chap:stats,chap:results}. In addition, the other contact and I created and developed the framework used for the background estimation and statistical analysis of the results. All plots and tables in this thesis were produced by me, unless otherwise stated. 

    Furthermore, I performed the statistical analysis in the search for contact interactions in the electron channel at $\sqrt{s} = $ \SI{13}{\tera\electronvolt} with an integrated luminosity of \SI{36.1}{\femto\barn^{-1}}~\cite{EXOT-2016-05}. Additionally, I worked in collaboration on a complementary background estimation procedure for the dilepton resonance search performed  at $\sqrt{s} = $ \SI{13}{\tera\electronvolt} with an integrated luminosity of \SI{139}{\femto\barn^{-1}}~\cite{Aad:2019fac}. These analyses are not discussed explicitly the thesis.

\begin{abstract}\pdfbookmark[1]{Abstract}{abstract}
    A search for new physics with non-resonant signals in dielectron and dimuon final states in mass ranges above \SI{2}{\tera\electronvolt} is presented. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \SI{139}{\femto\barn^{-1}}, were recorded by the ATLAS experiment in proton--proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \SI{13}{\tera\electronvolt} during Run-2 of the Large Hadron Collider.  A data-driven background extrapolation procedure is utilised to model the contribution from background processes. The benchmark signal model considered is the four-fermion contact-interaction, which results in an enhancement of the dilepton event rate at the TeV mass scale. No significant deviation from the expected background is observed in data. Observed and expected  95\% CL limits on the contact interaction energy scale reach \SI{35.8}{\tera\electronvolt} and \SI{37.6}{\tera\electronvolt}, respectively. In addition, 95\% CL limits on the number of events and visible cross section times branching fraction for new physics processes are provided.
